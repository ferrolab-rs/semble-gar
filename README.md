> **Note:** this is a fork of [MinishLab/semble](https://github.com/MinishLab/semble) enhanced with a **Graph-Augmented Retrieval** layer. All original hybrid search features are preserved. The graph layer adds relational context (`called_by` / `depends_on`) to every search result and boosts structurally important code via graph centrality — with zero new dependencies.

## What's new vs upstream

| Feature | Original Semble | Semble-GAR |
|---|---|---|
| Search | Hybrid (semantic + BM25 + RRF) | Hybrid (NDCG@10 identical) |
| Code graph | None | SQLite call + import graph (cross-file) |
| Symbols extracted | None | Functions, classes via tree-sitter |
| Imports resolved | None | `from X import Y` → scoped cross-file edges |
| Result context | Text only | JSON with `called_by` / `depends_on` |
| MCP output | Markdown blocks | JSON with relational metadata |
| Fallback | N/A | Silent vector-only on parse errors |
| New dependencies | — | **Zero** (sqlite3 stdlib, tree-sitter from Chonkie) |
| Upstream tests | 116 | 116 (all passing, no regression) |

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferrolab-rs/semble-gar.git
cd semble-gar
pip install -e "."        # Base install (CPU-only, zero extra deps)
pip install -e ".[mcp]"   # or with MCP server support
```

```python
from semble import SembleIndex

# Index a local directory
index = SembleIndex.from_path("./my-project")

# Index a remote git repository
index = SembleIndex.from_git("https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec")

# Search the index with a natural-language or code query
results = index.search("save model to disk", top_k=3)

# Find code similar to a specific result
related = index.find_related(results[0], top_k=3)

# Each result exposes the matched chunk
result = results[0]
result.chunk.file_path   # "model2vec/model.py"
result.chunk.start_line  # 127
result.chunk.end_line    # 150
result.chunk.content     # "def save_pretrained(self, path: PathLike, ..."

# Get relational context: who calls this code, what it depends on
ctx = index.get_context_for_chunk(result.chunk)
ctx.called_by   # ["model2vec/hub.py:10-25", "model2vec/cli.py:40-55"]
ctx.depends_on  # ["model2vec/persistence.py:100-130"]

# Trace a symbol through the call graph
graph = index.trace_symbol("save_pretrained")
graph["results"][0]["callers"]   # who calls this function
graph["results"][0]["callees"]   # what this function calls
```

## Main Features

- **Fast**: indexes a repo in ~250 ms and answers queries in ~1.5 ms, all on CPU.
- **Accurate**: NDCG@10 of 0.854 on our [benchmarks](#benchmarks), on par with code-specialized transformer models, at a fraction of the size and cost.
- **Graph-Augmented Retrieval**: extracts the code's call graph and import tree via tree-sitter, stores it in a zero-dependency SQLite graph, and boosts structurally important chunks while enriching results with `called_by`/`depends_on` context.
- **Token-efficient**: returns only the relevant chunks, using ~98% fewer tokens than grep+read.
- **Zero setup**: runs on CPU with no API keys, GPU, or external services required.
- **MCP server**: drop-in tool for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and any other MCP-compatible agent.
- **Local and remote**: pass a local path or a git URL.

## MCP Server

Semble can run as an MCP server so agents can search any codebase directly. Repos are cloned and indexed on demand, and indexes are cached for the lifetime of the session.

### Setup

> Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and a local clone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferrolab-rs/semble-gar.git
cd semble-gar
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

Then configure your agent to run `semble`:

#### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add semble -s user -- semble
```

#### Codex
Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.semble]
command = "semble"
```

#### OpenCode
Add to `~/.opencode/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "semble": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["semble"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor
Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "semble": {
      "command": "semble"
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Find code by intent. Supports `compact=true` to save tokens (omits code content). Returns `called_by` / `depends_on` / `symbols` so you can chain directly to `trace_symbol`. |
| `trace_symbol` | **"Who calls this? What does it call?"** — pass a function name, get its callers, callees, and centrality. No file reading needed. |
| `explore_graph` | "What symbols are in this chunk, and how is it connected?" — relational context for any location. |
| `find_related` | "What code is similar to this?" — semantic similarity search from a known location. |

#### Why this matters

Traditional grep+read workflow for understanding a function `resolve_alpha`:

```
grep "resolve_alpha"        → 50 matches, 800 tokens
Read ranking/__init__.py     → 5 lines, re-export only
Read ranking/weighting.py    → 11 lines, found definition
grep "resolve_alpha" src/    → found callers in search.py
Read search.py               → 160 lines, found search_hybrid calls it
Total: ~5 calls, ~8000 tokens
```

With Semble-GAR:

```
search "resolve_alpha"       → symbols: [resolve_alpha], depends_on: [ranking/weighting.py]
trace_symbol "resolve_alpha" → callers: [search_hybrid], callees: [is_symbol_query]
Total: ~2 calls, ~800 tokens
```

**10x fewer tokens per exploration task.** The `file_total_lines` field (e.g. `"file_total_lines": 200`) tells you whether a chunk is partial so you know when to Read.

Each result from `search` / `find_related` is returned as JSON:

```json
{
  "file": "model2vec/model.py",
  "line": "127-150",
  "file_total_lines": 385,
  "code": "def save_pretrained(self, path: PathLike, ...",
  "score": 0.95,
  "source": "hybrid",
  "symbols": [{"id": 42, "name": "save_pretrained", "type": "function"}],
  "context": {
    "called_by": ["model2vec/hub.py:10-25"],
    "depends_on": ["model2vec/persistence.py:100-130"]
  }
}
```

> **Compact mode:** pass `compact=true` to `search` or `find_related` to get only the first line of code (~60% token savings). Set `compact=false` (default) for the full chunk content.

### Sub-agent support

Claude Code and Codex CLI lazy-load MCP tool schemas, so sub-agents cannot call `mcp__semble__search` directly. The fix is to invoke semble through the [CLI](#cli) via Bash instead.

**Claude Code**: run this once in your project root:

```bash
semble init
```

This writes [`.claude/agents/semble-search.md`](src/semble/agents/semble-search.md).

**Other tools (Codex, etc.)**: append the following to your `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Code Search

Use `semble search` to find code by describing what it does or naming a symbol/identifier, instead of grep:

​```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
​```

Use `semble find-related` to discover code similar to a known location (pass `file_path` and `line` from a prior search result):

​```bash
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
​```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted.

## Workflow

1. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks.
2. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk is not enough context.
3. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
4. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.
```

## CLI

Semble also ships as a standalone CLI for use outside of MCP. This is useful in scripts, sub-agents, or anywhere you want search results without an MCP session.

```bash
# Search a local repo
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project

# Search for a symbol or identifier
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project

# Search a remote repo (cloned on demand)
semble search "save model to disk" https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec

# Find code similar to a known location (file_path and line from a prior search result)
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted.

## How it works

Semble splits each file into code-aware chunks using [Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie), then builds a **code relationship graph** powered by tree-sitter and SQLite. The graph captures function/class definitions, call edges, and import dependencies across files — without adding any heavy dependencies (sqlite3 is stdlib, tree-sitter is a transitive dependency of Chonkie).

At query time, Semble scores every query against the chunks with two complementary retrievers: static [Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) embeddings using the code-specialized [potion-code-16M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-code-16M) model for semantic similarity, and [BM25](https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s) for lexical matches on identifiers and API names. The two score lists are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

After fusing, results are enriched with relational context (`called_by` / `depends_on`) so agents understand not just *what* matches, but *how* the code fits into the codebase structure. A graph centrality boost is applied (NDCG-neutral on upstream benchmarks), and results are reranked with a set of code-aware signals:

<details>
<summary><b>Ranking signals</b></summary>

- **Relational context.** Every result is enriched with `called_by` / `depends_on` and `symbols` so agents understand how the code connects without reading files. A `trace_symbol` MCP tool enables call-graph navigation. Graph centrality boost is applied but is NDCG-neutral — the relational metadata is the real value.
- **Adaptive weighting.** Symbol-like queries (`Foo::bar`, `_private`, `getUserById`) get more lexical weight, while natural-language queries stay balanced between semantic and lexical retrievers.
- **Definition boosts.** A chunk that defines the queried symbol (a `class`, `def`, `func`, etc.) is ranked above chunks that merely reference it.
- **Identifier stems.** Query tokens are stemmed and matched against identifier stems in a chunk, giving an additional weight to chunks that contain them. For example, querying `parse config` boosts chunks containing `parseConfig`, `ConfigParser`, or `config_parser`.
- **File coherence.** When multiple chunks from the same file match the query, the file is boosted so the top result reflects broad file-level relevance rather than a single out-of-context chunk.
- **Noise penalties.** Test files, `compat/`/`legacy/` shims, example code, and `.d.ts` declaration stubs are down-ranked so canonical implementations surface first.

</details>

Because the embedding model is static with no transformer forward pass at query time, all of this runs in milliseconds on CPU.

## Benchmarks

### Upstream quality (original Semble)

These results are from the upstream [MinishLab/semble](https://github.com/MinishLab/semble) benchmark suite: ~1,250 queries over 63 repositories in 19 languages. Semble-GAR inherits the same hybrid search backbone and graph boosts are **additive** — they re-rank within the candidate pool.

![Speed vs quality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/speed_vs_ndcg_cold.png)

| Method | NDCG@10 | Index time | Query p50 |
|--------|--------:|-----------:|----------:|
| CodeRankEmbed Hybrid | 0.862 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| **semble (upstream)** | **0.854** | **263 ms** | **1.5 ms** |
| CodeRankEmbed | 0.765 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| ColGREP | 0.693 | 5.8 s | 124 ms |
| BM25 | 0.673 | 263 ms | 0.02 ms |
| grepai | 0.561 | 35 s | 48 ms |
| probe | 0.387 | — | 207 ms |
| ripgrep | 0.126 | — | 12 ms |

Semble achieves 99% of the performance of the 137M-parameter [CodeRankEmbed](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed) Hybrid, while indexing 218x faster and answering queries 11x faster. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md) for per-language results, ablations, and methodology.

### Graph overhead (Semble-GAR)

Measured on 21 Python files (~2 500 lines) — the `src/semble` codebase itself:

| Metric | Original Semble | Semble-GAR | Overhead |
|--------|----------------:|-----------:|---------:|
| Index time (graph only) | — | 77 ms | +3.7 ms/file |
| Relational context query | — | **0.10 ms** | negligible |
| Symbols extracted | 0 | 127 | — |
| Edges (cross-file) | 0 | 222 (127) | — |
| Memory (graph DB) | 0 | in-memory SQLite | ~0 (no disk) |
| New dependencies | — | 0 | sqlite3 (stdlib) |

> **Key takeaway:** the graph layer adds ~4 ms per file during indexing and 0.1 ms per search query. Both are well within the 25% indexing slowdown and 50 ms query latency constraints.

### Graph boost ablation

**Full upstream benchmark** on 26 repos, 521 queries, 19 languages. Compares `_GRAPH_BOOST=0.4` vs baseline (no graph boost).

| Metric | Baseline | GAR | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg NDCG@10 | 0.8715 | 0.8706 | **-0.0009** |
| Wins | — | 6 repos | — |
| Ties | — | 12 repos | — |
| Losses | — | 8 repos | — |

> **The graph centrality boost is statistically neutral on NDCG@10.** It does not harm ranking quality but does not consistently improve it either. The value of the GAR layer lies in the **relational context** (`called_by` / `depends_on`), the **`trace_symbol`** tool for call-graph navigation, and the **`file_total_lines`** field for detecting partial chunks — not in the centrality re-ranking. The boost is kept at a conservative 0.4; lowering it further would have no measurable impact.

### Token efficiency

Agents using grep+read spend most of their context budget on irrelevant code. Semble returns only the chunks that match, keeping token usage low even at high recall.

![Token efficiency: recall vs. retrieved tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/token_efficiency.png)

Semble uses **~98% fewer tokens** on average, and reaches 94% recall at a budget of only 2k tokens, while grep+read needs a full 100k context window to reach 85%. These numbers are from the upstream benchmark (identical hybrid search backbone). The GAR layer adds:

| Field | Overhead per result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `context` (called_by/depends_on) | ~100-200 chars | Relational metadata |
| `symbols` | ~50-100 chars | Function/class names in chunk |
| `file_total_lines` | ~25 chars | Chunk completeness signal |
| `compact=true` | **-60%** | Omits `code` field entirely |

> Net effect: +5% overhead in full mode, **-55% in compact mode**. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md#token-efficiency) for details.
